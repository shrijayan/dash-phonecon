# Overnight Auto-Research Backlog

Shared file between the BA/PM persona (adds to Proposed) and the Engineer
persona (moves Proposed -> Shipped or Abandoned). Newest proposals go at
the TOP of their section. Read `.overnight/GUARDRAILS.md` before touching
this file or the codebase.

## Proposed

*(seed ideas below — grounded in the actual linux/ client code as of
2026-07-10; PM persona should treat these as a starting point, not a
constraint, and keep adding more each cycle)*

1. **Reconnect banner in the call popup.** `ui/call_popup.py` /
   `network/call_server.py`: when `connection_changed` emits `False`
   while a call is active, the popup currently has no visual indicator
   the phone link dropped. Add a small "Phone disconnected" banner state.
2. **Tray icon: show device label on hover only, status in bold.**
   `ui/tray_icon.py`'s `_status_label()` currently always shows the same
   plain menu item. Minor UX polish, small + safe to try first as a
   warm-up.
3. **Config file for port override.** `network/call_server.py` hardcodes
   `DEFAULT_PORT = 8765`. Add optional `~/.config/dash-phonecon/config.json`
   read (port override only, default unchanged) so a user with a port
   conflict isn't stuck. Additive, no protocol change.
4. **Structured logging: log connection duration on disconnect.**
   `network/call_server.py`'s `_handle_client` logs "Phone disconnected"
   with no context — add elapsed connection time to the log line using
   `logging_setup.py`'s existing logger. Small, test-friendly (can assert
   on log records).
5. **`CallState` history / last-call summary.** `state/call_state.py` +
   `state/call_state_controller.py`: track the last N call events
   in-memory (caller name/number, duration, timestamp) purely for the
   tray dropdown ("Last call: John Doe, 2m 14s ago") — no persistence
   required, keep it simple.

## Shipped

*(engineer persona appends here, format: `- [SHA] feat: description
  (timestamp)`)*

## Abandoned

*(engineer persona appends here, format: `- feat: description — reason
  (timestamp)`)*
